0.4.0
New:
    * Added new ship, the Calidris!
    * Added additional cockpit indicators to calidris (g-force, assist status, limiter, lights, boost status)
    * Added independent thrusters with shader effect + spacial audio emitters
    * Lots of new sound effects in the cockpit and multiplayer-aware boost + thruster sounds
    * Added ship thruster trails (thanks Tavi!)
    * Added new biome test world with 8k textures, let me know how this performs!
    * Ship lights and thrusters are shown on other ships in multiplayer (local player lights are prioritised in renderer)
    * Added basic support for gravity
    * Added snapshot sfx to checkpoint 

Changes:
    * Updated to Unity 2021.1.17f1
    * Flight model changes:
        * Halved the default boost multiplier
        * Halved the torque multiplier
        * Doubled the regular non-boost base thrust N
    * Increased terrain world draw distance by 1 tile in all graphics scenarios (so anywhere from 33 to 100 percent increase)
    * Free roam now has ability to select location (removed experimental terrain flag)
    * Updated Cloudy terrain to have a more interesting skybox
    * Split boost sound between front and back and made boost action multiplayer-aware
    * VR HMD position => input bind (default F11) now works in pause menu etc, should *always* restore from preferences
    * Checkpoint collision checking now uses velocity-based raycasts and should work with any arbitrary speed

Fixes:
    * Fog no longer interacts with transparent objects (e.g. checkpoint)
    * VR view no longer brighter in right eye on terrain v1 (?!)
    * Cockpit camera position is now clamped for ridiculously fast builds
    * Options menu correctly re-initialises on show (previously maintained unsaved changes)
    * Tweaked exact positions of sun light sources
    * Space dust no longer fails to move origin with ship
    * Split timer fade out works correctly if two checkpoints are hit close together (would fade out super fast as an extra co-routine would start)
    * Fixed race condition with floating origin as it previously updated outside the physics update loop (oops!)
    * Mouse widget UI elements resets to center if mouse input is disabled (Thank you Lignar!)
    * [Linux] Mouse constrains to window correctly (Thank you Lignar!)
    * [Linux] Scroll speed + direction now consistent with windows build (Thank you Lignar!)

0.3.0
New:
    * Multiplayer - enormous refactor to a client => server architecture.
        * Lobby system - only host may make changes
            * Ready-up system
            * Chat box (lobby only for now)
        * Complete overhaul of loading logic.
        * Ability for non-host players to warp to the host (replaces Restart functionality).
        * Ability for host players to return all players to the lobby.
    * Targeting system - currently not user-selectable but draws a target and distance for elements in the world on the ship cockpit glass 
    * Menu system segregates single and multiplayer - oooo new icon buttons!

Changes:
    * Lighting pass on terrain worlds - terrain now renders shadows onto itself and other entities.
    * Shadow pass - shadows draw much further and have multiple levels of cascade. The cockpit effectively has an entire shadow map to itself.
    * Flight model changes:
        * Pulling back on the throttle at all now decreases forward thrust UNDER BOOST by up to 40% - previously this only worked on the bottom 40% of the axis and is now spread across the whole reverse axis.
        * Any residual thrust can now be pushed into lats + verts - this, by virtue of applying reverse throttle, applies automatically with vector flight assist when making tight maneuvers. 
    * Removed experimental HQ terrain - was worth a try but it ran poorly on many systems and caused multiplayer instabilities
    
Fixes:
    * Space station has had a much-needed collider pass, should now be able to fly between fine geometry details
    * Changing the default flight assist dropdown option will now apply that option immediately (no need to add key binds) 

0.2.2b
Fixes:
    * Apply rigidbody physics along with specialised ship param defaults on load. Sigh.

0.2.2
New:
    * Added VR toggle button in options (using param -vr still works but this is much simpler to toggle at runtime)
    * Added experimental high resolution terrain toggle - this MUST be used in conjunction with terrain LOD graphics option or you're going to have a bad time as it renders about 20 million triangles at max quality! Set to about 70-80% for a good balance. Looking for feedback.
    * Added less-noticeably repeating cliff edge texture
    * Added ability for people to build the github repo without paid assets
    
Changes:
    * Ship physics changes - scrapped shared thrust pool changes, thank you to everyone who gave feedback!
        * Increased mass to 1100Kg
        * Increased tensor multiplier to 175 to reduce spin on collision
        * Decreased torque by 25% (this is to balance a change to the ship mesh - size affects rotation!)
        * Decreased lateral thrust multipliers (lats by 28%, verts by 22%)
        * Decreased boost thrust and rotation effect time by 1 second each  
    * Ship model changes
        * Ship cockpit now 20% smaller - this feels WAY better in VR, flat screen should see very little change
        * Removed the front piece of the ship mesh, it made the ship look unnecessarily long and crooked
    * Lighting changes to noon clear (less orange tint, more vibrant summer colours)
    * Improved terrain and ship lighting on a per-environment basis (auto-regen baked lights of additive scenes on load)
    * Removed Fog Distance option - this is now auto-calculated based on the terrain type (chunk size) and chunk count.
    * Removed alpha message in favour of static text at bottom of main menu

Fixes: 
    * Remove redundant default FA toggle (replaced with drop-down!)

0.2.1

New:
    * Added dev flag for additive thrusters ("trichording") which effectively re-enables old behaviour WRT thrust sharing.
        * This allows each axis to operate with it's own max thrust amount and the flight params are now balanced for shared thrust. Feedback purposes only, Use at your own peril.

Changes: 
    * Swapped default flight assist for a drop-down of 4 possible options (all on, rotational only, vector only, all off). 
    
Fixes:
    * Fixed FA On boost drop-off being too harsh.
    * Fixed incorrect throttle assignment under boost (max forward should be 1, it was 1 + 1.6!).
        * This fixes the laterals being completely ineffective under boost.
    * Fixed incorrect rotation on VR HMD reset in certain ship orientations (quaternions are fun!)

ALPHA 4 (v0.2.0)
-------
New: 
    * VR Mode: Set the `-vr` flag parameter when launching the exe to use OpenXR. Do this either with steam or by making a shortcut to the exe.
        * Added HMD recenter binding - this is F11 by default.
        * NOTE: VR moe uses OpenXR - it is WINDOWS ONLY at the moment until Unity adds Linux support!
        * Custom cursor drawn in-scene on the UI canvases - this allows mouse operation in VR.
    * Graphics options!
        * Resolution [Applied instantly]
        * Screen mode (borderless / fullscreen / windowed) [Applied instantly]
        * Camera Field of View
        * Render scale 
        * MSAA
        * SSAO
        * Various terrain settings
    * Boost now has a recharge mechanic - holding the button will always boost when available, but repeated boosts are punished with drained capacitor.
        * Added values to dev options
    * Throttle no longer effectively max under boost - there is up to 40% draw back which can be achieved by pulling back.
    * Ship lateral thrusters no longer act on independent max thrusts - they share the same max thrust pool and therefore may be bled off.
        * Some ship agility re-balancing has occurred due to this change, see Changes below
    * Time Trial start timer with sound
        * Counts down from 2.5 seconds (beep on 2, 1, 0)
        * Boost is available 1 second before start, holding the button beforehand works
    * Added thrust + boost indicators
    * Added binding to use lateral vs rotational flight assists
        * Toggling both will defer to default preference (e.g. if usually on, will enable both if only one is active and disable if both active)
    
Changes:
    * Buffed ship agility 
        * Mass decreased by ~20%
        * Max available thrust increased by 10%
        * Boost thrust multiplier increased by 40%
        * Vertical thruster multiplier increased by ~12%
        * Horizontal thruster multiplier increased by ~30%
    * Removed placeholder display UI elements in cockpit and replaced them with ... absolutely nothing ^_^
    * Renamed input option "flight assist on by default" to "prefer flight assists on" (now multiple assists)
        
Fixes:
    * Timer no longer displays when restarting a free roam session
    * User preferences are now applied on startup by the Game class rather than User in-game
    * Track name is now serialised when copied to json
    * Fixed some binding options not displaying device name
    * Fixed SSAO shadow artefacts 
    * Possible fix for loading terrain on Linux (MM C++ Native loader is windows only :|)

(v0.1.5)
-------

Fixes:
    * Ship configuration default was not correct (boost time wrong by 1 second)
        * This should not affect times, but the end timer will be green if not changed ship params
    * Timer now correctly resets if terrain load is required
    * Ultrawide resolution fixes
        * Timer now displays clamped to top of screen
        * Options menu now fully scrolls to the bottom 

ALPHA 3 (v0.1.4)
-------

New:
	* Added multiple environment types and separated from map geometry (additive scene management).
	* Added ship spotlight + associated input binding for night maps (Default 'L' on keyboard).
	* Added experimental terrain (see Developer options in options menu!)
		* This terrain will take a while to load, here to gauge feedback.
	* Lighting pass - baked lights, per-environment volume lighting and dramatically improved in-cockpit shadows
	* Flight Assist rewrite - now functions like ED
	* Added placeholder sfx for flight assist toggle (reuses the alternate flight toggle)
	* Reduced rotational torque by 50% - it was uncontrollable under boost
	* Flight model changes
		* Added thruster multipliers to ship parameters
		* Mass reduced by 30% (results in gain of thrust and torque)
		* Overall torque reduced by 50%
		* Yaw torque increased by 60%
		* Horizontal lateral thrust reduced by 50%
		* Vertical lateral thrust reduced by 20%
		* Boost recharge time reduced by 1 second (20%)
    * Added mouse settings
    	* Sensitivity 
    	* Dead zone
        * Invert axis

Fixes: 
    * Shadow cascading now operates between two extremes - 0-1m and 1-2000m. This means an entire shadow map is dedicated to the cockpit and massively sharpens the texture while eliminating awful shadow flicker.
    * Updated to latest preview of the input system which now supports VJoy - you can now pipe any device through a VJoy driver and have it work in-game. It's not great but it's better than nothing if your device doesn't work :|

ALPHA 2 (v0.1.3)
-------

New:
    * Immediate restart: the game will endeavour to place the ship back at the starting location (either from custom level, race or regular free play) with as little loading time as possible. This I feel was especially important given the nature of the race tracks - short and difficult.
    * Changes to race mechanics: the ship now starts at the initial checkpoint and you can no longer re-run the race. This is to make sure races are entirely fair and cannot be gamed with timing the boost when entering the start point or waiting for moving features in the race track to pass.
    * Boost mechanic improvements: the velocity max speed no longer suddenly jumps from 932m/s to 800m/s, it gradually reduces (see the devlog video for more info on this)
    * Physics adjustments - ship less likely to get into an insane uncontrollable spin when clipping terrain
    * Level loader split from free roam, now respects locations (e.g. Space station custom maps)
    * Additional ship physics and mechanics parameters exposed in dev panel
    * Added an in-game console (use the ` key) to quickly debug input issues in release builds

Bug fixes:
    * Huge amount of input changes, should support far more devices. Let me know how you get on, virpil sticks still don't work, sorry! I'm trying :(
    * Fixed errant inputs on load (level starts with ship already in motion)
    * Fixed thrusters remaining on after alt flight control toggle (this still needs more work but it's uhm... broken in a slightly better way? Sorry, Nova!)

ALPHA 1 (v0.1.1)
-------
{ Initial release }
