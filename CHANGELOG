0.2.2
New:
    * Added VR toggle button in options (using param -vr still works but this is much simpler to toggle at runtime)
    * Added experimental high resolution terrain toggle - this MUST be used in conjunction with terrain LOD graphics option or you're going to have a bad time as it renders about 20 million triangles at max quality! Set to about 70-80% for a good balance. Looking for feedback.
    * Added less-noticeably repeating cliff edge texture
    * Added ability for people to build the github repo without paid assets
    
Changes:
    * Ship physics changes - scrapped shared thrust pool changes, thank you to everyone who gave feedback!
        * Increased mass to 1300Kg
        * Increased tensor multiplier to 175 to reduce spin on collision
        * Decreased torque by 25% (this is to balance a change to the ship mesh - size affects rotation!)
        * Decreased lateral thrust multipliers (lats by 28%, verts by 22%)
        * Decreased boost thrust and rotation effect time by 1 second each  
    * Ship model changes
        * Ship cockpit now 20% smaller - this feels WAY better in VR, flat screen should see very little change
        * Removed the front piece of the ship mesh, it made the ship look unnecessarily long and crooked
    * Lighting changes to noon clear (less orange tint, more vibrant summer colours)
    * Imprived terrain and ship lighting on a per-environment basis (auto-regen baked lights of additive scenes on load)
    * Removed alpha message in favour of static text at bottom of main menu

Fixes: 
    * Remove redundant default FA toggle (replaced with drop-down!)

0.2.1

New:
    * Added dev flag for additive thrusters ("trichording") which effectively re-enables old behaviour WRT thrust sharing.
        * This allows each axis to operate with it's own max thrust amount and the flight params are now balanced for shared thrust. Feedback purposes only, Use at your own peril.

Changes: 
    * Swapped default flight assist for a drop-down of 4 possible options (all on, rotational only, vector only, all off). 
    
Fixes:
    * Fixed FA On boost drop-off being too harsh.
    * Fixed incorrect throttle assignment under boost (max forward should be 1, it was 1 + 1.6!).
        * This fixes the laterals being completely ineffective under boost.
    * Fixed incorrect rotation on VR HMD reset in certain ship orientations (quaternions are fun!)

ALPHA 4 (v0.2.0)
-------
New: 
    * VR Mode: Set the `-vr` flag parameter when launching the exe to use OpenXR. Do this either with steam or by making a shortcut to the exe.
        * Added HMD recenter binding - this is F11 by default.
        * NOTE: VR moe uses OpenXR - it is WINDOWS ONLY at the moment until Unity adds Linux support!
        * Custom cursor drawn in-scene on the UI canvases - this allows mouse operation in VR.
    * Graphics options!
        * Resolution [Applied instantly]
        * Screen mode (borderless / fullscreen / windowed) [Applied instantly]
        * Camera Field of View
        * Render scale 
        * MSAA
        * SSAO
        * Various terrain settings
    * Boost now has a recharge mechanic - holding the button will always boost when available, but repeated boosts are punished with drained capacitor.
        * Added values to dev options
    * Throttle no longer effectively max under boost - there is up to 40% draw back which can be achieved by pulling back.
    * Ship lateral thrusters no longer act on independent max thrusts - they share the same max thrust pool and therefore may be bled off.
        * Some ship agility re-balancing has occurred due to this change, see Changes below
    * Time Trial start timer with sound
        * Counts down from 2.5 seconds (beep on 2, 1, 0)
        * Boost is available 1 second before start, holding the button beforehand works
    * Added thrust + boost indicators
    * Added binding to use lateral vs rotational flight assists
        * Toggling both will defer to default preference (e.g. if usually on, will enable both if only one is active and disable if both active)
    
Changes:
    * Buffed ship agility 
        * Mass decreased by ~20%
        * Max available thrust increased by 10%
        * Boost thrust multiplier increased by 40%
        * Vertical thruster multiplier increased by ~12%
        * Horizontal thruster multiplier increased by ~30%
    * Removed placeholder display UI elements in cockpit and replaced them with ... absolutely nothing ^_^
    * Renamed input option "flight assist on by default" to "prefer flight assists on" (now multiple assists)
        
Fixes:
    * Timer no longer displays when restarting a free roam session
    * User preferences are now applied on startup by the Game class rather than User in-game
    * Track name is now serialised when copied to json
    * Fixed some binding options not displaying device name
    * Fixed SSAO shadow artefacts 
    * Possible fix for loading terrain on Linux (MM C++ Native loader is windows only :|)

(v0.1.5)
-------

Fixes:
    * Ship configuration default was not correct (boost time wrong by 1 second)
        * This should not affect times, but the end timer will be green if not changed ship params
    * Timer now correctly resets if terrain load is required
    * Ultrawide resolution fixes
        * Timer now displays clamped to top of screen
        * Options menu now fully scrolls to the bottom 

ALPHA 3 (v0.1.4)
-------

New:
	* Added multiple environment types and separated from map geometry (additive scene management).
	* Added ship spotlight + associated input binding for night maps (Default 'L' on keyboard).
	* Added experimental terrain (see Developer options in options menu!)
		* This terrain will take a while to load, here to gauge feedback.
	* Lighting pass - baked lights, per-environment volume lighting and dramatically improved in-cockpit shadows
	* Flight Assist rewrite - now functions like ED
	* Added placeholder sfx for flight assist toggle (reuses the alternate flight toggle)
	* Reduced rotational torque by 50% - it was uncontrollable under boost
	* Flight model changes
		* Added thruster multipliers to ship parameters
		* Mass reduced by 30% (results in gain of thrust and torque)
		* Overall torque reduced by 50%
		* Yaw torque increased by 60%
		* Horizontal lateral thrust reduced by 50%
		* Vertical lateral thrust reduced by 20%
		* Boost recharge time reduced by 1 second (20%)
    * Added mouse settings
    	* Sensitivity 
    	* Dead zone
        * Invert axis

Fixes: 
    * Shadow cascading now operates between two extremes - 0-1m and 1-2000m. This means an entire shadow map is dedicated to the cockpit and massively sharpens the texture while eliminating awful shadow flicker.
    * Updated to latest preview of the input system which now supports VJoy - you can now pipe any device through a VJoy driver and have it work in-game. It's not great but it's better than nothing if your device doesn't work :|

ALPHA 2 (v0.1.3)
-------

New:
    * Immediate restart: the game will endeavour to place the ship back at the starting location (either from custom level, race or regular free play) with as little loading time as possible. This I feel was especially important given the nature of the race tracks - short and difficult.
    * Changes to race mechanics: the ship now starts at the initial checkpoint and you can no longer re-run the race. This is to make sure races are entirely fair and cannot be gamed with timing the boost when entering the start point or waiting for moving features in the race track to pass.
    * Boost mechanic improvements: the velocity max speed no longer suddenly jumps from 932m/s to 800m/s, it gradually reduces (see the devlog video for more info on this)
    * Physics adjustments - ship less likely to get into an insane uncontrollable spin when clipping terrain
    * Level loader split from free roam, now respects locations (e.g. Space station custom maps)
    * Additional ship physics and mechanics parameters exposed in dev panel
    * Added an in-game console (use the ` key) to quickly debug input issues in release builds

Bug fixes:
    * Huge amount of input changes, should support far more devices. Let me know how you get on, virpil sticks still don't work, sorry! I'm trying :(
    * Fixed errant inputs on load (level starts with ship already in motion)
    * Fixed thrusters remaining on after alt flight control toggle (this still needs more work but it's uhm... broken in a slightly better way? Sorry, Nova!)

ALPHA 1 (v0.1.1)
