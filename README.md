## A love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community ‚ù§

Yes, racing exists in Elite and yes it's awesome -- but accessible it is not. 

This project aims to provide a ground-up reimplementation of a similar-enough flight model to provide a training ground and common set of tools to track leaderboards, ghosts and general tom-foolery. Feedback is extremely welcome!

Interested in getting involved with the dev process? Come join the discord and ~yell at me about how wrong I am~ discuss where we should take this!
